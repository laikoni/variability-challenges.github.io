        What is the number of valid configurations for Linux? How to generate uniform random samples for Linux? Can we
        create a binary decision diagram for Linux? It seems that the product-line community tries hard to answer such
        questions for Linux and other configurable systems. However, attempts are often not published due to the
        publication bias (i.e., unsuccessful attempts are not published). As a consequence, researchers keep trying by
        potentially spending redundant effort. The goal of this challenge is to guide research on these computationally
        complex problems and to foster the exchange between researchers and practitioners.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h4>What is the holy grail of the product-line community? A binary decision diagram for Linux.</h4>

        Linux is an operating system with thousands of configuration options. These options cannot be arbitrarily
        combined, as every option typically comes with constraints with respect to several other options. Constraints
        are specified in KConfig, but can be translated into feature models or propositional logic. Whenever we analyze
        the Linux kernel for errors, ignoring those constraints would lead to false positives. That is, tools would
        report errors for invalid configurations, which cannot be used to compile a kernel. Hence, these constraints are
        crucial for any kind of analysis of Linux.<br><br>

        A <b>binary decision diagram</b> (short BDD) is data structure representing a propositional formula. While there
        are multiple representations of propositional formulas, BDDs can have the advantage of reducing NP-complete
        problems into more tractable problems (aka. <b>knowledge compilation</b>). For instance, checking whether a
        formula represented as a BDD is satisfiable is an operation with constant effort. While operations on BDDs might
        scale well, the downside of BDDs is that their construction can be intractable. The main reason for the
        scalability challenge is that the variable ordering heavily influences the size of the BDD and they tend to
        explode for most variable orderings.<br><br>

        <h4>Why do we argue that a BDD for Linux is the holy grail of the product-line community?</h4>

        First, it seems to be a challenging task. To the best of our knowledge, no one has been able to create a BDD for
        Linux so far. In <a
          href="https://www.uni-ulm.de/fileadmin/website_uni_ulm/iui.inst.170/publications/2020-VaMoS-Sundermann.pdf">recent
          work</a>, we tried to create a BDD for hundreds of large feature models and failed for 98\% of them (i.e.,
        100\% of models having more than 550 features). Furthermore, even though other knowledge compilation techniques
        scaled to many large feature models, not a single knowledge compilation tool scaled to Linux when we tried to
        compute the number of valid configurations. Similarly, <a href="../../2019/Sampling/index.html">t-wise sampling
          algorithms typically do not scale to Linux</a>.<br><br>

        Second, there is a considerable amount of research that is based on the translation of the feature model into a
        BDD. In the past two decades, researchers proposed the use of BDDs to count the number of valid configurations,
        to compute feature-model slices and differences, for interactive product configuration, to check whether
        product-line artifacts are consistent, to parse preprocessor-based product lines, to simplify preprocessor
        annotations, and to lift test-suite generation, data-flow analyses, or model checking to product lines. If we
        aim to apply that research to Linux or similarly complex configuration spaces, it is an open question whether
        BDDs can be created for them.<br><br>

        Third, there are many advantages of having a BDD. While it is widely accepted that satisfiability solving scales
        well for product lines, the potential advantage of a BDD is that one-time effort for the construction can
        pay-off when the BDD is later employed in follow-up analyses. The potential is amplified by several factors.
        First, a feature model is typically changed less frequently than implementation artifacts. As a consequence, a
        new BDD only needs to be created when the feature model changes. Second, for every new revision of the product
        line there are several analyses needed of which each typically is reduced to numerous satisfiability problems.
        It is likely that a large portion of the satisfiability problems can be solved more efficiently using a
        BDD.<br><br>

        <h4>What is the goal of this challenge?</h4>

        While our claim about the holy grail is focused on BDDs and Linux, there is a more general challenge behind this
        specific one. Linux is just one example of a large-scale configuration space. A BDD is just one example of a
        knowledge compilation technique. The goal of this challenge is to promote the problem of knowledge compilation
        for large-scale configuration spaces. In particular, this challenge is not only focused on software
        configuration, but also configurable systems and product configuration. Furthermore, any representation of the
        configuration space that invests offline computations (i.e., compilation) in favor of faster online computations
        would fall into the scope of this challenge.<br><br>

        What is the problem of the current situation? Many product-line researchers seem to address very similar
        problems for various reasons, but largely without documenting their failed attempts. Other researchers are most
        likely repeating the same mistakes again. The goal of this challenge is to make this problem explicit, to give
        researchers a forum to discuss attempts, and to exchange ideas on possible solutions.

        <h3>On the scalability of building binary decision diagrams for current feature models</h3>
        <i>Tobias Heß, Chico Sundermann and Thomas Thüm</i><br />
        SPLC 2021 Solution<br />
        Binary decision diagrams (BDD) have been proposed for numerous product-line analyses. These analyses typically
        exploit properties unique to decision diagrams, such as negation in constant time and space.
        Furthermore, the existence of a BDD representing the configuration space of a product line removes the need to
        employ SAT or #SAT solvers for their analysis. Recent work has shown that
        the performance of state-of-the-art BDD libraries is significantly lower than previously reported and
        hypothesized. In this work, we provide an assessment of the state-of-the-art of BDD scalability in
        this domain and explain why previous results on the scalability of BDDs do not apply to more recent product-line
        instances.<br />

        <h3>Configuring BDD Compilation Techniques for Feature Models</h3>
        <i>Clemens Dubslaff, Nils Husung and Nikolai Käfer</i><br />
        SPLC 2024 Solution<br />
        The compilation of feature models into binary decision diagrams (BDDs) is a major challenge in the area of
        configurable systems analysis. Many large-scale feature models have been reported to exceed state-of-the-art
        compilation capabilities, e.g., for variants of the Linux kernel product line. However, experiments have been
        mainly conducted on standard settings of the BDD compilers themselves, not taking advanced configurations into
        account.

        In this paper, we investigate the impact of various BDD compilation techniques for compiling feature models in
        conjunctive normal form. Specifically, we evaluate preprocessing techniques from satisfiability (SAT) solving,
        variable and clause ordering heuristics, non-incremental construction schemes, as well as parallelization of BDD
        construction. Our experiments on current feature models show that BDD compilation of feature models greatly
        benefits from these techniques, enabling to construct many previously no constructible large-scale feature
        models within
        seconds.<br />
